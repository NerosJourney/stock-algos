# Stock Algorithm Comparisons

## The Idea

I want to use Alpaca's Paper Trading API to simulate a number of different ideas that I have for stock market algorithms.
These ideas include a sentiment analysis of twitter, a sentiment analysis of google news articles, past stock data, and
tweeting a poll to vote for buy or sell.
